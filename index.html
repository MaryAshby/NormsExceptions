Norm & Exceptions
</title>
</head>


<body>
<p> In chapter six of his book, The Truthful Art, Cairo examines the stories that data can tell. 
  Stories can be found in two aspects of data: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> What is the norm of the data?</li>
    <li> What are the exceptions to that norm?</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> The norm is where most of the data rests. There are various ways of determing norms. These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The median</li>
    <li>The average</li>
    <li>The mean</li>
    </ul>
      
      <p>The exceptions are the outliers. The data that may be skewing the average. The points on the chart that sit out side
        the warmth of the data points.</p>
