Norm & Exceptions

  <h1> Where is the story?</h1>
  <p> In chapter six of his book, <u>The Truthful Art</u>, Cairo examines the stories that data can tell. 
  Stories can be found in two aspects of data: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> What is the norm of the data?</li>
    <li> What are the exceptions to that norm?</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> The norm is where most of the data rests. There are various ways to determine norms. These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The median - the number that falls in the middle of the data set.</li>
    <li>The mean - all the numbers in the set added together and then divided by the number of numbers (it is also known as the average).</li>
    <li>The mode - the most common number in a set.</li>
    </ul>
      
      <p>The exceptions are the outliers. The data that may be skewing the average. The points on the chart that sit outside
        the concentration of the data points.  For example, in this chart of my history of cat ownership, the median is 1
       , the mean is 3.5 
        (round to 4), and the mode is 1. The mean is skewed by the datapoint of seven cats. </p>
  <p> The story could be about the librarian with one cat (norm). Or the crazy librarian who once owned seven cats (exception). And what was the story about
    the year with no cats (exception)? What was the total number of cats owned over the 35 years (follow up question not answered by data given)? 
    Do other librarians follow the same pattern?
    Looking at both the norms and the exceptions helps the journalist or data scientist tease out the information that can add insight to a greater issue.
